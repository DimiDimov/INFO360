    <h2>Process Book week 2</h2>
    <p>Coping with transition into blindness. In the first video the transition that she goes through is turning blind. She said that it happened to her about a year ago and she had a very rough transition, specifically at the very start. The clear challenge that she faced was the physical one that she couldn’t see, but it went even farther than that, later in the video she mentions that since she didn’t have physical control over her vision she decided that she needed physical control of something so she started being a sort of anorexic.
        She also mentioned in a part that being blind put a strain on her socially. She said that she wouldn’t feel like going out to parties with her friends anymore because of her blindness. Also I saw that one of her other videos was titled “when sighted people forget you” so I can imagine that there was a strong separation between her and her friends when she became blind.
        The actual main topic of the video however was the emotional challenges that she faced. She mentioned things such as that she would cry often about it and would often feel depressed that she wasn’t able to do a lot of the things that she used to. She said there are coping techniques that she used to deal with the stress such as riding her bike inside but they would only work when she was up for doing them and she would often just resort to crying.
        The second video dealt with the several transitions. The first of which was the transition that happened in the 20th century of humans getting better health care and medicine. This extended the average lifetime of people from 45 to almost double that. This transition at first seemed to be all positive but then she mentioned that this caused deaths to be more prolonged with a longer sick stage. This caused a bad emotional impact on everyone that had to spend time in hospitals.
        The second transition was one that she mentioned that she would want to be implemented but has not yet been fully yet. She wanted to transition from having boring designs for hospitals to better, more decorative designs. She went on to describe that this transition would help make the bad emotional impact from the previous transition better.

    <p>I was interested about this so I looked up a picture of a modern hospital and found that a lot of them actually have been working to make better designs. </p>

    <p>This is a picture of my phone. I use it every day for activities such as texting, calling, taking notes, setting alarms, and remembering tasks. Usually I’m the only person that uses it.
        It has both physical and digital aspects for several reasons. The physical parts on it are firstly, the touchscreen which has to be able to sense finger touches. Secondly, the hardware pieces of it such as the battery, processor and case which are required to make it work. Lastly, something that was mentioned in class was the accelerometer which is a necessary physical part for some of the software applications to work such as the rotation screen digital aspect and is also incorporated in things like games for steering and for shake to activate features.

    <p>This is a picture of a coffee maker that is a fairly similar model to the one that I have. I use it usually twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. I am not the only person that uses it but it has built in functionality for four users and I am one of the four main users.
        It has the physical components such as the water input container, the coffee input container, the milk input container that needs to be stored in fridge. All of these physical components are important because they need physical care in order to stay operational. There is also another genre of physical components, the ones that are responsible for interacting with the digital ones such as the buttons and the LED screen that displays the settings. There’s the on button, the users button, the cappucinno button, the coffee button, arrow buttons, and a menu button.
        The digital aspects of the coffee maker are the ones that interact with the button pushes and are what display the user interface on the LED screen. The most complex part of the coffee maker is the multiple users function that stores a specific set of setting for each user for each type of coffee. This is mostly done though pushing the menu button and changing the amounts of each setting type. All of these button pushes shows resulting screens on the LED screen

    <p>This is a picture of a microwave that is fairly similar to the one that is in my room. It is used by both me and my roommate and its sole purpose is to heat up food that we intend to eat or microwave water for tea or hot chocolate.
        The physical components of the microwave are the buttons that are for adjusting settings, the led screen that shows the time, the door that contains the microwaves in the microwave, the dish inside the microwave that always gets off its track, and the machine that makes the microwaves that heat the food.
        The digital aspects of the microwave are mostly the set of setting that are set with each of the button. Also the built in timer that is adjustable based on how long you want to microwave the food. Finally the settings that display what is supposed to be displayed on the LED screen are also digital.

    <p>This is a picture of my laptop, it is a Lenovo 530 that is about 2 years old and it still works fairly well. It is used for mainly school and entertainment purposes and it is used by only me.
        The most obvious physical aspect of the laptop is the one that I interact with the most and that is the keyboard. There are also several hardware aspects that all interact with the digital aspects. There is the monitor that displays all the content to the user. There is the battery which powers the entire device. The CD drive, the solid state drive that stores all the memory, the motherboard that connects all the parts, the processor, and probably several other parts.
        The digital part of the laptop is mostly windows 7 which is the installed operating system that connects all of the parts and makes the user able to use the computer by making a user interface that they know how to use. There are also other digital parts in the computer such as all of the programs installed on the hard drive.

    <p>Another technology that my roommate and I share is our tv. It is used mostly by us but sometimes by other people as well. The way that it is used most often is by being connected to the Xbox 360 playing Fifa 2015.
        The physical parts of the TV are the buttons on the side that are for turning on the TV, changing channels, and adjust the volume. There is also the display, and all of the plugs that are for different inputs such as HDMI, and the TV stand.
        The digital parts of the TV are the software that takes what the input gives them and converts it into a picture to display. Also the software that controls the volume output from the speakers.

    <img src="img/17.png" style="width:304px;height:228px;"></br>
    <p>flip crepe and then heat for another 45 seconds, the top part should be somewhere between brown and white and not burnt but not runny, if it is runny, flip back over and increase heat</p>
    <img src="img/18.png" style="width:304px;height:228px;"></br>
    <p>after cooked stack on a plate, repeat last 2 steps with each crepe until mixture runs out, keep stacking crepes on same plate as shown on picture to maintain warmth</p>
    <img src="img/19.png" style="width:304px;height:228px;"></br>
    <p>for each crepe apply some amount of Nutella or other desired topping</p>

    <p>The idea behind my n+1 version is to have more entertainment functionality to the website. I want to do this by adding the hardest classes and hardest schools functions. The intent of these is to have students look at them to see how hard other classes are at other schools and get to laugh at the ridiculous work load at school such as MIT and Harvard. Having more entertainment added to the site will hopefully increase the amount of users.
        The other part added was the introduction demo. It is just a link to a short 1-2 minute video explaining the functionality of the website. Its purpose is to make user experience less frustrating if they can’t figure out how to use a feature.
